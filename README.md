# HTX Dataset
The drone changes its position at a fixed altitude during recording to keep up with moving targets. However, the sudden camera movements lead to inaccurate measurement-to-track association (M2TA) and
degrade tracking performance.

In this dataset, there are 6 targets. The camera contains pannig, tilting and zooming.
 Each frame has a size of 1920*1080 pixel.

 Researchers can use this scenario to publish papers.
